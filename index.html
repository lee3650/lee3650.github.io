                I've had two internships while at college: one at Optum Labs and one at Bane Welker. Both were amazing learning experiences and ton me a <em>*ton*</em> about developing software in a professional environment.

                I started programming when I was in 6th grade, about 10 years ago, and I've accumulated quite a few projects along the way. 
                You can read more about them in the <span class="inline-code">`Projects`</span> tab, but here are some highlights:
