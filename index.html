                Thanks for stopping by! I'm Isaac Lee, a student at Purdue University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with minors in English and Math.

            ## ⚒ Work Experience 
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've had two internships while at college: one at Optum Labs and one at Bane Welker. Both were amazing learning experiences and taught me a <em>*ton*</em> about developing software in a professional environment. 
            </p>
            <h3>
                ### Optum Labs
            </h3>
            <p>
                I worked at Optum Labs in the summer of 2022, from June-August, after my sophomore year at college. I worked on two projects at Optum Labs: 
                <ul>
                <li>
                    An automated ingestion program that downloaded survey data into a database from Qualtrics. Survey ingestion time compared to a manual process was decreased about 20x. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Building reusable components with React, which I tested with Jest and Playwright. 
                </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            Labs was my first professional experience in the software industry, and definitely taught me some of the practices that separate professionals from amateurs, for example, storing configuration in text files, having tests associated with each pull request, and doing code reviews. 
            <h3>
                ### Bane-Welker
            </h3>
            <p>
                I currently am working at Bane-Welker as IT intern, which will last from June-August.

                ## ♥ Personal Projects 
            </h2>
            <p>
                I started programming when I was in 6th grade, about 10 years ago, and I've accumulated quite a few projects along the way. 
                You can read more about them in the <a href="/projects" class="normal-link">Projects</a> tab, but here are some highlights: 
            </p>
            <h3>
                ### Arcane Assembly 
            </h3>
            <p>
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356150/Arcane_Assembly/" class="normal-link">Arcane Assembly</a> is a spell-programming metroidvania I'm currently working on in my spare time. 
                I've definitely incorporated a lot of what I've learned about software development into this project, for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Configuring the game with a text file and having different dev and build configurations
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Automating tedious build and deployment steps by writing custom tooling 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Writing automated tests to ensure correctness 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                ### Time tracking utility
            </h3>
            <p>
                I never came up with a good name for this, but it's a time tracking visualizer for files of a certain format. It was made using React, ReCharts, and is hosted on firebase. You can try it at <a class="normal-link" href="https://declarativetime.com">declarativetime.com</a>.

            <p>
                Archipelago is a roguelike tower defense game, which I on steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811940/Archipelago/" class="normal-link">here</a>. It was made with Unity and C#, and to date has sold about 1600 copies.
