                ## Arcane Assembly
            </h2>
            <p>
            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2356150/Arcane_Assembly/" class="normal-link">Arcane Assembly</a> is an upcoming spell-programming metroidvania.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'd say the #1 lesson I've learned from this game is automate everything, especially if you're a solo developer with limited free time. 
                <br>
                <br>
            Whether or not the game is a success, I'm proud of the progress I made in this game in terms of developer experience and tooling as compared to my last projects. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Here's a few things I did: 
            </p>
            <h3>
            ### Level editor
            </h3>
            I wrote unity editor scripts to transform .png files edited using <a href="https://www.aseprite.org/" class='normal-link'>aseprite</a> into levels/rooms for the game. Each pixel represents one tile, and the color represents the tile type. Here's an example: 
            <div class="containImage">
                <img src="BranchVis-export.png" alt="Pixel art level"/>
            </div>
            Then in Unity, I select the image, press <span class="inline-code">`ctrl-shift-d`</span>, and a new scene is created, the contents of the image are parsed and transformed into the given level. 
            Here's what the above scene looks like in game: 
            <div class="containImage">
                <img src="parsed_img_ingame.png" alt="Pixel art level" width="50%"/>
            </div>
            The light blue pixel in the level definition corresponds to the wooden bench on the right. 
            <p>
                This has saved me <em>*tons*</em> of time overall, and easily has repaid the amount of time I spent writing it. Building levels is a good candidate for automation since I do it so frequently - there's something like 200 rooms in the game.
            </p>
            <h3>
                ### Build and test tools 
            </h3>
            I got <em>*very*</em> tired of manual testing when I was working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1811940/Archipelago/">Archipelago</a>, so for this project I wrote an automated test system.<br> <br>In general, 
            games are difficult to test automatically. For Arcane Assembly, I'm using a system of recorded input. You can start recording by typing 
            <span class="inline-code">`recordtest {testname}`</span> in the console, then all input will be recorded until you press <span class='inline-code'>~</span>. <br><br>The input is saved to a file, so you can play it back programatically and write tests for expected end state.
            <br><br>
            There's definitely disadvantages to this system - floating point non-determinism means that recorded input will not be played back exactly, especially for long tests, and any tests involving the mouse break if UI elements move. 
            However, it's still better than 100% manual testing, and of course I have some unit tests for more 'functional' parts of the game. 
            <h3>
                ### Misc
            </h3>
            A few more things of note: 
            <ul>
                <li>Arcane Assembly the language: a Turing complete programming language that you can edit using a visual drag and drop UI. Basic PL development was, like simple shader code and netcode, honestly <em>*way*</em> easier than I expected. 
                    The implementation in the game is pretty badly done, but I recently discovered Robert Nystrom's <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com" class="normal-link">Crafting Interpreters</a>, so 
                I think I could do better in the future. Someday I'd like to make a "real" programming language. <ul><li>Well, technically the <em>*implementation*</em> is Turing complete, but the set of instructions exposed to the player is not for balance reasons.</li><li>Of course, making a Turing complete language is not that impressive, considering you only need to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-instruction_set_computer" class="normal-link">one instruction</a>.</li></ul></li>
                <li>Developer console: has support for <span class="inline-code">`src {filename}`</span> commands, so I can write long, reusable scripts.</li>
                <li>Build/deployment tools: I have a simple build script which builds the game, copies it to a specific directory, and moves a bunch of text configuration/data files into specific places in that directory. Then I also wrote a simple wrapper script for the Steam CLI to make deployment a little easier.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                ## Time Tracker
            </h2>
            <a href="https://declarativetime.com" class="normal-link">This project</a> is just a JS visualizer for text files that contain time tracking data in a certain format. 
            I cranked this project out in 11 days while on vacation. Overall it was fairly straightforward, though JS for large projects gets old very quickly. If I were doing this again, I'd use TypeScript. 
            <br>
            <br>
            There was significantly less interest in this when I was than I expected, which I suppose proves the old adage that developers don't understand what users want. 
            <h2>
                ## Other projects
            </h2>
            <h3>
                ### Archipelago
            </h3>
            I released Archipelago on Steam in January 2022. I was fortunate enough to have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFqYs8AE4MQ" class="normal-link">Wanderbots</a> 
            play it on stream, which drove a decent number of sales. Last time I checked it was at 1824 copies sold, most of which were at a discount.
            <br>
            <br>
            I definitely <em>*learned*</em> a lot from the project, mostly of what <em>*not*</em> to do - i.e., 
            don't rely on manual testing, don't ship builds that were built with a Unity version that's like, 4 years out of date, don't go like, 6 months into a project 
            with no clear plan or vision of what it should look like, etc.

                ### This website
            </h3>
            This is barely a project, but this website is made with plain HTML, CSS, and a little JQuery for putting the header on each page. 
            <h3>
                ### Older
            </h3>
            A few years ago I made some productivity software: <a href="https://hopa.itch.io/scheduler" class="normal-link">Scheduler</a>,
             a way to make personal, daily schedules, and <a href="https://hopa.itch.io/habidoro" class="normal-link">Habidoro</a>, a time tracking / habit tracker app based on the pomodoro technique.
              I've definitely learned a lot since these projects, and I plan to remake at least Scheduler at some point in the future.
